  <p><span class="sc">A return to the source</span> may be taken to mean a return to a history as an effort to revise, to amend, to rectify, but it is also an effort to encounter a source as the beginning of something that holds within the possibility of alteration. Returning is a deliberate task&mdash;it defies temporality without losing site of historical precedents; it is also a journey that can dislocate and discover a truth, but not settle on it. For Amilcar Cabral, from whom we have conceptually borrowed the title for this publication, a return to the source was a provocation that reflected on those who could transform the history of Guinea, and more specifically those who would fight against “the foreign culture but also the foreign domination as a whole.” His was an urgent call to forge collective identity where the masses are the basis for the constitution of the struggle. For Cabral, as for other revolutionaries before and after him, liberation was a historical process, a slow-moving force that required an understanding of the present conditions, and thus affected by time, as much as by geography, and social and political orders.</p>

  <p><em>Return to the Source</em> is also the title of a book published by the Africa Information Service in 1973. It translated a number of Cabral’s essays and speeches as an attempt to locate a source from which to situate the trajectory of the PAIGC (Partido Africano para a Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde, or the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde) and more so of Cabral as one of its leaders, while also positioning us, the readers, as a part of a history largely occluded from the “accumulation of facts” we associate with revolutionary fervor. Cabral was murdered in 1973, after having started the fight for liberation in 1956. In that heap of years Cabral dedicated to the intellectual and on-the ground struggle, the world was set on firefrom Việt Nam to Mexico to Chile to the streets of many cities across the United States–by people seeking their own liberation.</p>

  <p>The historical record has given us fragments of these events, and has positioned 1968 as a particular moment of revolutionary activity, as if the year could stand on its own temporal plinth. However, institutions, the same ones that repress us–in all of its forms–across various geographies, have a certain durability that supercede the narratives around the event. And so while slow-moving, revolutions (and revolts as their preludes), are in constant motion pushing to correct the record, or make other pieces of their whole available for collective view.</p>

  <p>Our source, perhaps in the most literal sense, is the archive, which we’ve charged with the task to help us “understand the processes through which the forgetting of violent encounter is naturalized, both by the archive, and in the subsequent narrative histories,” as Lisa Lowe contends. The contributions in this publication also point us to a geographical scope where historical relationality is woven through what the archive illuminates in their poetic and material encounters.</p>
  <p>We do not see these histories outside of the definition of crisis according to Gramsci as moments of disruption of possibilities, nor do we see them as being truth-finding devices. We see them as traces of</p>

   <p class="intro-footnote">
    When history is separated itself from story, it started indulging in accumulation and facts. Or it thought it could. I thought it could build up to History because the Past, unrelated to the present and the Futures lying there in its entirety, waiting to be revealed and related. &mdash;Trinh Minh Ha <em>Woman, Native, Other</em></p>
