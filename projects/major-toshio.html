<p>For many years, Miss Major has been a mother figure and hope-giver to young trans and queer people and their allies across the world. At the age of seventy, she became an icon outside of queer- and queer-adjacent communities, as a documentary about her life, increased trans visibility in the mainstream media, and the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising initiated wider attention around her lifetime(s) of activism. </p>

<p>While hooking in Lower Manhattan during the 1960s, Major was one of the regular "gurls" who copwatched before there was a word for it, and made mental notes of the vehicles and license plate numbers of each others' johns, just in case. </p>

<p>At the end of the decade she also played the role of note-taker for the New York chapter of the Mattachine Society, an early queer political organization with an assimilationist focus. "I didn't last there very long," she says, remembering the many Mattachine members didn't appreciate the times she laughed out loud during meetings as they devised plans meant to win respect by fitting in. The meetings were filled with "men wearing skinny ties, in skinny suits," whose trainings on how to be perceived as masc or femme by people outside the community were, from Major's point of view, flops from their conception. She was one of the trans women who was only recently acknowledged for her part in  fighting against the government- and mafia-backed police in 1969, when queer and trans people controlled much of New York's Village for six days that June.</p>

<p>However, Major tells me, "I never considered myself a political person" until she met Frank "Big Black" Smith, one of the leaders of the 1971 rebellion at Attica prison, while they were both incarcerated in a solitary confinement wing of Dannemora prison, in upstate New York. </p>

<p>Major had an intimate knowledge of many of the tentacles of the prison industrial complex long before her transfer to Dannemora (the common name for Clinton Correctional Facility, after its location in Dannemora, New York). She'd experienced abusive correctional officers who ran the Cook County Jail in her hometown, Chicago, and in New York City precinct jails and Riker's Island. She was even more familiar with a medicalized arm of the system: the locked psychiatric ward at Bellevue public hospital, where the city often dumped gender nonconforming people in the 1960s. Bellevue's "pavilion for the insane" was a precursor to maximum security civil commitment "hospitals," where most "patients" are held indefinitely after serving their prison sentences. As the protests of summer 2020 continue over police murders of George Floyd, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor, and others, and prisons surpass nursing homes as the most dangerous place to be during the COVID-19 pandemic, calls to defund and/or abolish police departments are tempered by the blueprinting of indefinite holding pens for drug users and homeless people. With public relations-minded names such as "Behavioral Health Justice Center," the system is morphing to silence widening outrage over the conditions for people inside, rebranding just as it did after Attica and the rebellions of the 1970s. Those struggles fought some of the same "powers that be," as Major calls the corporate, government, and nonprofit actors who work to preserve the status quo, powers that offered little more than superficial concessions. (A very literal example came through the reformist idea of "Rehabilitation," the term added to the letterhead and signage of prisons around the US during the years following the uprising at Attica, but more often makeovers only increased their brutality--in the case of Attica, the buildings were outfitted with a system of pipes that can release tear gas in case of future uprisings.)  </p>

<p>When she met Big Black, Major was early into a five-year sentence at Dannemora, the New York prison that "might as well have been Africa," given its distance from New York City--the prison is just twenty miles south of the Canadian border--and its high concentration of Black people that is the mark of so many other places of confinement.</p>

<p>In 2014, the Los Angeles County Men's Central Jail opened its "progressive" transgender-only jail wing. It was the first segregated all-trans pod in the country, and another innovation of the system allowing it to hoard additional resources. Many trans prisoners continue to be isolated in solitary confinement, under the banner of protecting them from other prisoners. The State held Major in the solitary wing at Dannemora, which is where it shipped Black after he helped lead four days of negotiations with the State, whose intention all along was to massacre Black and his comrades, not to address the 27-point Manifesto of Demands. The demands included the discontinuation of slave wages (Black made 30 cents a day in the role of "warden's laundry boy") and the allowance of labor unions; lack of access to books; lack of doctors; and an end to the stoking of racial violence by prison administrators, who feared racial solidarity among prisoners so much that they punished people under different race classifications for the most innocuous of activities, such as sharing letters from home and giving each other haircuts. ( In a declassified phone call with then-President Nixon, New York's governor Nelson Rockefeller valorized the dehumanization of Attica's, telling the president the operation had been a "fabulous success" that would stamp out future rebellions.)</p>

<p>Far away from other comrades who'd survived the uprising, Black and Major managed to form a friendship through the walls of solitary. With Black's mentorship, she formalized in her mind some of the things she already knew from experience, like prisons are for the most part a twisted extension of slavery, dressed up as “criminal justice”. He also introduced her to concepts that were new to her--for example, how Clinton Correctional Facility is for the town of Dannemora, New York, just like General Motors was for Detroit, or Boeing was for Southern California. Prison towns are just like other company towns, sustained by a core industry, people flocking there for a check, and for Dannemora, incarceration was the industry that wrote the checks. They talked about the leadership role she could fill for her gurls--how she could encourage them to learn about their oppression, and how to fight it. Her politicization during this time led her to understand the importance of community, and chosen parental figures or role models who can affirm that you're not wrong to question the State's version of justice. </p>

<p>When she left Dannemora, Major brought these conversations to her "gurls" back in the City and then her future homes in San Diego, the Bay Area, and Little Rock. </p>

<p><img src="../images/major_toshio/Major with Debbie and Billy.jpg"></p>

<p>One of the gurls was Ceyenne Doroshow, a Black trans organizer who is known for organizing sex workers in New York. At a conference of the Desiree Alliance, a national coalition focused on decriminalizing sex work, Ceyenne sat down at Major's table during dinner. She explained that she was a blood daughter of Big Black, who'd died a few years prior, in 2004. She addressed Major as "Mama," and they formed a mother-daughter relationship as strong as blood. </p>

<p>For a forthcoming book on Major's activism, we spoke about living in a society where the justice system privileges the most privileged, and oppresses the already oppressed, and how that informed Major's embrace of abolitionist politics. Major describes the system in the way that Black, Ceyenne, and other comrades and family members understand it: Not as a broken system in need of reform, but a system working the way its overseers intended it to, which works to turn every reform into an opportunity to grow its domination.</p>

<p><smallcap>Toshio Meronek</smallcap> The massive scale of organizing that Big Black was part of at Attica--over 1,000 prisoners involved in the uprising. In your conversations with him did you talk about how hard must that have been to do, given the limitations of being inside a prison cell?</p>

<p><smallcap>Miss Major</smallcap> And those are? </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> Would you say that outside is not that different from inside in terms of organizing protests?</p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> Well, look at it this way: It was easier in there because the guys were objects of police brutality. So, if you were going to talk to them about what was going on, they were more receptive to it. So I wouldn't say it was harder--and in some ways it was easier in there than it is on the outside. Inside, it's not as though you have other things that are taking control of your interest. When Black started to give me books to look at or explain how things were, I was more receptive. When he taught me about how towns spring up after you put a prison somewhere, how the towns surround the prison and the prison sustains the town--and that's everything from clothing, to what you can eat--I was more receptive.  </p>

<p>Most of the men--well, women now too--but most of the men in the town worked in the prison, so they'd never be traveling too far. If they were, say, in upstate New York, they would put the prison close to the city. In Dannemora, they put a prison in what was basically a field field, twenty miles from Canada.</p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> Before Dannemora, did time inside jail, or Bellevue--this hospital that at the time was basically a prison by another name--how did your time there change your definition of what the [air-quote motion] justice system is?</p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> As soon as I got arrested it changed my point of view as to what the justice system was, because I saw when I went to jail for the first time, that it is not fair. The white boy that was with me went home, and I went to a cell. So the system was never set up to be fair, and what prisons were to were made to do, they are doing. So this thing about putting up hospitals in the place of jails to deal with indigent people is bullshit, because jails aren't going to do anything for indigent people. </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> Right. The conservatorship jails that are in the works. Another question about your time with Black, and the sixties and seventies in general: Did you identify with a particular ideology around the State? Black had you reading the Communist Manifesto...</p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> No, I didn't--no group. Like having the Mattachines, or even some of the organizations I've started up, they worked with certain aspects of who I was at the time. I would take what was useful for me and use it, but if it wasn't useful to me, I didn't bother. </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> And it sounds like you didn't find that much that was useful at the Mattachine Society. Did you find anything that was useful from that experience?</p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> That was a funny experience, but no, I could not take them very seriously at all. It was useful, because I got to see what their point of view was on the times. And I looked for that sort of thing. The Mattachine Society gave me that point of seeing that for some people, assimilating into society is what they want. And so when the guys would dress up and this obsession of pretending to be straight, pretending to be whatever the hell it is they perceived to be masculine, when you saw it, it was funny--there's no way around it. </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> You never committed to an organization like the Mattachines, never associated with any particular political party, per se. Just thinking back to the first Pride, and how trans people weren't invited, did that affect your choice in terms of not considering yourself a member of the movement groups at the time? </p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> At first what it was was there was so many white people. [For TLGBQ people] there were so few groups of color, and then if you saw color, it was one person walking in the middle of a group of white people. So it lost its meaning, to me. And when [gay rights emerged in the 1960s] I got busted, and then I started my five-year sentence. So, no, that didn't have much meaning for me. And then by the time I got out to see the [Gay Pride] Parade, it was just... I didn't bother. </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> With the Mattachine Society, were you the only Black person in the room, do you remember?  </p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> When there were, it might be one lesbian couple, sat way in the back. </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> Talking about Black you've mentioned solidarities between struggles, and how struggles overlap, and intersectionality. Black trans organizing, was there solidarity with the struggle of, like the Black Panthers, which Big Black was a member of? </p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> It's like the bottom of the totem pole--the people at the intersections have all the others standing on their shoulders. So, the bottom of the totem pole has the most strength, they're the ones who are buried in the deepest concrete. But the way [many of the non-queer/trans people in Left movements who claim to speak on behalf of queer/trans people] talk about it is, we're standing on their shoulders. You can't raise up to the heights without securing whatever the base is. So if the base is ignored, you have nothing to stand on.</p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> When did you start to understand the idea of tokenization? Choosing someone from the base to tokenize, as a means to cause drama and split all the people up at the bottom? By holding up just one person instead of, what you spoken on a lot: That Black trans women benefit by putting up a united front. I remember after some screening of the documentary [MAJOR!], somebody came up to you and they were like, "You know, I've never felt like I've been in situation where we aren't being pitted against each other," and how it meant so much for them to see the love that you showed for--whoever it was, Melenie or Tracie--or any of your gurls. That it was possible to love another trans woman and not be in competition with them. </p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> Looking back now, when the "powers that be" have tokenized us--given the attention to one of the group by making them feel that, "Well, you are different, you are special"--they usually do that in order to turn the rest of us against that person. That way they keep us separate. If everyone got to thinking that everybody is the same, and that everyone deserves health care, a roof over their heads, a clean shower--it's a hard thing for them to fight against. The thing about Black, was, everything that he did was about putting the Black person first. He told me he saw me as Major, </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> Major, the individual.</p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> Yeah. I was just Major, and then I was "Major, the Black person," and then I was "Major, the transsexual." He didn't put anybody aside, or talk to one out of a group, and then ignore the rest. I guess I had an idea that it was the right way to approach organizing the gurls. At least, it didn't seem to me that that was so incorrect that it was wrong. And so in looking at that idea of, well everyone's a human being when it comes down to it, it opened your eyes to what was really going on at the time, the injustices. And he explained that it had been going on for years before. What he tried to teach us is, "It's been going on for at least three hundred years." Three hundred years was a long time to wait and hold on, and be patient, and turn the other cheek, so he stopped us from doing that. </p>

<p><smallcap>TM</smallcap> When I'm talking to you about what's going on in the world, it's helpful to have someone who's been through a lot more shit than I, for a lot longer, to reassure me that it's not wrong to feel like the world is fucked up beyond repair, but that you can try to repair what you can, using whatever skills you might have.</p>

<p><smallcap>MM</smallcap> With Black, as far as leadership goes, it was on you to decide what you could handle from your position. What he taught us and told us, it was up to you to take what you needed, and put the other stuff aside. It was the first time I'd realized I was in control in that way, and that I could put the other stuff aside. That idea came back into my consciousness when I was working with the gurls, and so I applied it with the gurls and it worked: to see everybody, everybody has suffered. One wasn't luckier than the other, that it doesn't do anyone any good to think like that. We all struggle.</p>
