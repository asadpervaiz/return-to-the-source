<p>The time between the 1950s and 1970s is the milestone marking radical change in the political configuration of the post-Second World War era. While the divided world juxtaposed itself ideologically during the Cold War, Southeast Asia was intensely hot during the so-called Vietnam War, also variously referred to as the American War depending on which side it was seen from. Nevertheless, Vietnam and its conflict were viewed primarily through the lens of the Western media as a worldwide product, the perception of a small country in a much larger geopolitical debate.  This is the point of departure in Vietnam The Movie, an essay film by Nguyễn Trinh Thi. In examining de-colonization, this essay will analyse Trinh Thi’s film through the wu-wei lens of Taoism, a Chinese ancient religion and philosophy which also has roots in the culture of Vietnam for thousands of years.</p>

<p class="quote">
“The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao.<br/>
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.<br/>
The nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth.<br/>
The named is the mother of the ten thousand things.<br/>
Ever desireless, one can see the mystery.<br/>
Ever desiring, one sees the manifestations.”
</p>

<p>The starting point of wu-wei, literally understood as the philosophy of nonaction or doing nothing, is dealing with the notions of the Named and the Nameless in Tao. As everything is made of the two elements Yin and Yang, Tao is about the natural way of maintaining things in balance, harmony and coherence. The Yin element is associated with earth, the quiet, female, intuitive and receiving force. Yang is associated with heaven, the strong, male, creative and giving force. Within Yin is the seed of Yang and vice versa. The Yin-Yang principle is the rhythm of cosmos, when Yin reaches its climax, it recedes in favour of Yang and so does Yang. The cyclical change is eternal. Based on this principle, Tao seems to do nothing but be able to maintain things in a perfect condition of change in balance and peace. That’s called wu-wei.</p>

<p>However, “the Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao”, so whatever words are written on the Tao are simply a shadow of its true nature. So, the truth in sense of Tao is unsayable. The un-/sayable is related to the notion of Name. Whatever thing is named, in its Yin-Yang cyclical change, it becomes precise no more. So, things which cannot be named, are associated with the Nameless. The Nameless is the beginning of Heaven and Earth, the origin of balance and harmony, the Tao or the only truth. The Named has tendency of becoming inaccurate and imbalance by causing plurality. Opposite to the harmonious monism of the Nameless, pluralism of the Named is the cause for politics and chaos.</p>

<p>From this point of view, the notion of the Named and the Nameless can often be applied in the moving image works of Nguyễn Trinh Thi. Raising different debates in cinematography, Trinh Thi often chooses positions for her protagonists or her own viewpoints beyond the frame. This artistic footprint is left in many of her moving images. In Vietnam the Movie, the artist chooses a way of viewing Vietnam through the dominant cinema that goes beyond the polarized debates of East and West, women and men, and so on. Selecting recuts related to Vietnam from the Hollywood blockbuster to European art house and Asian movies made between 1958 and 2013, Trinh Thi recontextualizes existing events, which are named, in order to raise other issues, which are unable to name in her film. Through the wu-wei lens, this essay will scrutinize the Nameless amongst the Named in the artwork in order to reveal a different way of debating decolonization.</p>

<p><h4>The nameless</h4>
Through the meticulous and critical mining of single shots, within each of which Vietnam is named, Trinh Thi has created a playful combination of contrasting binaries between factors, images, sounds, and within spaces or dialogues. A pluralist world has been presented as a quiz game with hundreds of warm or very warm answers, all except bingo. Amongst thousands of names aiming to articulate Vietnam, the Nameless comes out in surprising forms.</p>

<p><h4>The joke</h4>
In the midst of many other serious events, Vietnam the Movie is interleaved surprisingly with jokes. Significantly, a little French joke starts the film and a silent joke in Vietnamese gives it an end. The first scenario in Vietnam the Movie presents a dialogue on a complex relationship between Étienne, an Asian man, with his adoptive French mother. In the conversation, Étienne described about a conference to her: “The lobby was full of people. Police, security, barriers. I realized how ridiculous the situation was. I pictured myself jumping on an Indo-Chinese woman, yelling: ‘Mama!’”. In the whole scene, Indochina is mentioned lightly as an adjective added to a strange woman, who could be Étienne’s biological mother amongst thousands of other people in the conference in the ironical description. This serious personal matter is accompanied by the broken high heel shoe. “I broke my heal”, said the mother, is the conclusion of the conversation like a joke. The joking scene changes to her back turning to the screen, the background is a farther shore, accompanied with the atmospheric and dramatic music suggesting Indochina is left behind with its colonial destiny. The conference turns out to be the Geneva Conference which was seriously taken place in 1954 “inaugurating the division into two separate nations of what would henceforth be called Vietnam.” The glory and nostalgic scene with a little French joke is closed but opens up to thousands of the Named coming consecutively thereafter as a much bigger joke.</p>

<p>Not only in French, in the film, Vietnam is mentioned in many other languages such as English, German, Japanese, Korean, and even Chinese but not the native one. The only Vietnamese word in the whole film is spoken in silence as a finissage of the show.  Written in colourful capital sans-serif letters, “HẾT” as the conclusion of the film, signifying the end. For those who understand Vietnamese, this word can be very ambiguous. It could mean equally nothing else to say, or express a disappointment as things are so normal, nothing special. For those who do not know Vietnamese and follow the film in English, it has no meaning. The final joke!  </p>

<p><h4>The randomness</h4>
As a phenomenon, after the French left their colony Indochina behind, to the West, Vietnam became a synonym with a war in which the country was divided briefly historically into two nations, geo-politically the North and the South. Meanwhile the Cold War divided the world into communist and capitalist blocs, named as the East and the West. This naming was taken by the geo-political division of Europe as the central point. So, the North of Vietnam belonged to the East&mdash;according to the European division, or in another name, the communist bloc, and the South consequently belonged to the Western capitalist bloc. Backing the battlefield, between the North and the South Vietnam, were the East and the West.</p>

<p>This issue is intensively recalled in Vietnam the Movie via a war named Vietnam. Amongst a number of characters excited about this event, depicted in various scenes throughout the film, there is only one little boy wishing no division of the nation. In front of his mother’s bedroom, he explains about his dream of two twins embedded into one as a metaphor of the unification of Vietnam. Such a sweet dream is concluded with a seemingly unrelated question on “what is the language?” asked by the child and the blinking eyes of the mother. In this scene, Vietnam is named randomly between dreams and spontaneous thoughts of a child.</p>

<p>However, within the world of adults in the whole film, Vietnam constantly appears as an exciting destination for Western men to speed up their careers. For instance, in a quick shift of tone and era, Vietnam the Movie changes its images from the glorious closing of the French colonial chapter into the lousy atmosphere of an American diner, in which Tom Cruise as Ron Kovic in Born on the Fourth of July wants to be “a part of history“ by coming to Vietnam. This excitement is, however, in contrast with the following scene showing a disoriented character in the form of a young Nick played by Christopher Walken in The Deer Hunter naming Vietnam together with other random things just coming to his mind like the deer and the trees. </p>

<p><h4>The irritation</h4>
The film begins however with a very quiet question, which is hardly to be in focus. It is just white writing letters on the black screen, silent as a Yin voice raising to a group of American school children inquiring if any of them know what the capital of Vietnam is. Though, the answer given is “Vietnam War!“. Afterwards, there comes the first glory scenario of the closing French colonial chapter mentioned above and thousands of consecutive events related to the war in Vietnam named in pluralism. So, the film begins with the first irritation, which surely causes to the one who follows the artist’s question as an innocent’s theatre of the absurd.</p>

<p>In undisguised black humour, irritations caused by differing realities are composed in dual dimensional spaces, in which Vietnam seems to be nowhere or somewhere in-between surreality and reality, between heaven and earth.  For instance, following the bird’s eye view of a pilot from his airplane, Vietnam appears as just a vast landscape of green rice paddies. The voice over accompanying the high aerial perspective is from a third person relating the pilot Dengler’s surrealistic experience of bombing Vietnam as a barbaric dream accompanied by Tuva throat singing. Shifting from that height with exotic world music down to earth with a shouting soldier is a more intimate scene. Here we are shown an American sergeant teaching new soldiers about Việt Cộng, chiêu hồi and the hard-core “motivated, highly-trained, and well-equipped” North Vietnamese relating his experiences of nights and rains. In contrast, behind the troops is, however, a naked aboriginal man with a B40 rocket cutting through the barbed wire with a simple plier. It is during the day, and it’s sunny.</p>

<p>The Vietnam War and its nostalgia are carried out in a variety of Western cultural styles in a variety of lousy restaurants and bars, and elite cinemas and opera houses. Playing with that irritation till the end, the epilogue presents a Vietnamese revolutionist who feels a longing for his bourgeois life in Paris, the colonial time and the revolution. His conversation with his friend is, however, carried out in Chinese and ends with a promise of having the best French food in Đà Nẵng. Then comes a male French voice speaking in a whisper urging us to forget about Vietnam - together with forgetting Hiroshima, Auschwitz, Budapest, the housing problem and the famine in India, and about his getting back to zero. All of this against a visual background of commercial products; like an advertisement. Like a movie.</p>

<p><h4>The generalization</h4>
Generalized in different ways, Vietnam is perceived as such through mostly commercial cinematic screens. Playing with the concept of generalization, most of the characters in Vietnam the Movie have no name, especially the soldiers and female entertainers who are involved in the war itself. As a bittersweet joke, a scene from Coppola’s Apocalypse Now portrays a soldier confusing the name of a Playboy centerfold from Ms. May to Ms. December. Pushing this generalization to the extreme, Trinh Thi even takes the most general quote “Vietnam the Movie” from an American soldier. In the original scene in Full Metal Jacket, soldiers sprawl in position for filming after the fierce Mậu Thân battle in Huế 1968. Amongst them is a soldier nicknamed Cowboy, who shouts loudly “It’s Vietnam the movie” to the TV journalists as a typical day in the field. Reusing this title for the film, Trinh Thi repeats the popular phenomenon as a generalization of a country no matter what its objective reality is. At the time of Cowboy’s suggested title, it meant clearly and ironically to describe this Western experience, but over half century later, in another context, it becomes meaningless. So is Trinh Thi’s film named, but it is also unnamed. </p>

<p><h4>The named</h4>
Within the Named, Yin-Yang elements could be seen in gender issues and power positions through what is named or unnamed. Contrary to the playfulness, the aural and visual presentations are sometimes awkward. Related to Vietnam or the Vietnam War, images of men as Yang elements are often in the form of American or Korean soldiers, either praised for heroism or as desperate veterans whose lives are descended into alcohol, drugs and physical or psychological damage. Or all of the above.  On the other hand, the roles of women&mdash;Yin elements&mdash;are far more limited appearing either as war entertainers or prostitutes. The Saigon call girl with broken English intriguing American soldiers on the sidewalk embedded with Nancy Sinatra’s music is an example of how gender structure is reified through these kinds of representations in Vietnam throughout the war mechanism.</p>

<p>While this binary is often repeated in American cinema, in European art house movies Vietnam is named as a decorative element of varying bourgeois lifestyles in the rest of the Western world. For instance, in cold Sweden the Vietnam War is presented as news played in the background of a scene with psychiatric patient Elisabet Volger wandering around in a mental hospital room. In France, the country of love, the Vietnam War is presented as an issue related to communism and American imperialism amidst the love affairs and flirting conversations in, for example Godard’s Masculin Féminin.  Whether play acting theater about political actors in the Vietnam War, attending an orchestra and thinking of Indochina, or characters at the cinema watching a movie about this topic while holding a book on art history, it is Europe that is being defined at a time when Vietnam is named.</p>

<p>The characters of  Japanese and German cinema explored in Trinh Thi’s film appear more serious in taking Vietnam into their further issues but not much about the country. In the recut of Nagisa Oshima’s Sing A Song Of Sex, while signing an anti-Vietnam War petition, a Japanese woman emphasizes her signature with three large capital letters ‘XXX’. Or in Harun Ferocki’s Before Your Eyes: Vietnam, the German man must be shot during the sound of gunshots on the evening news to disguise the sound of his execution. In Fassbinder’s The American Soldier, upon being asked how Vietnam was, Ricky (Karl Scheydt) responds, “Loud“ as the only word to describe Vietnam and emphasize how boring Germany is.</p>

<p>In addition to  Hollywood and European art house movies, Korean and Hong Kong movies are also included. However, throughout there are still only discourses of either colonialism or de-colonization along the lines of Western priorities. The voice of ‘the others’ and their concerns are notable for their complete absence. Names and No-names are subtly embedded in the concept of the Named. All named events related to Vietnam are spoken and relate singlehandedly to war. However, Yin elements as softer voices&mdash;unconsumed in the West, are entirely avoided. </p>

<p>Back to the beginning: the artist, a Vietnamese woman, in asking her very simple question inquiring about the name of Vietnam’s capital city (where she was born), finds no answer in her film even after a long visual journey of almost an hour. This initial conversation is presented without voice or commentary, just a white serif font on the black background as if written in white chalk on a blackboard.  This is easily forgotten after the many dozens of colorful visual events that follow. In order to speak to this American audience, the language she uses is English.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the most essential questions about Vietnam are raised mostly by children in the Trinh Thi’s film. However, responses to their questions are either no-answers like the response from the mother in Godard’s film described above or a very awkward answer, like that of Lt. Coker’s reply to a young student’s question, “What’s Vietnam like?”, he replies, “If it wasn’t for the people, it was very pretty. The people over there were very backward and very primitive. They just made a mess out of everything.” The clip, from Hearts and Minds by Peter Davis, is documentary footage of a classroom visit in New Jersey by Lt. George Coker after seven years as a POW in Vietnam. In Trinh Thi’s edit, after Lt. Coker gives his opinion about Vietnam the clip ends with the young children standing up with more questions which are not asked. The continuing issues for young children as Yin elements remain unnamed.</p>

<p>The scene echoes the children named in the first classroom scene and the following conversation between Étienne and his adoptive mother, also unnamed. His biological mother was just mentioned as a mere anonymous Indochinese woman, even her outlook as a person is absent in the scene. So, the Vietnamese people in daily life remain absolutely unnamed as in Lt. Coker’s assessment, a beautiful country spoiled by its own nameless citizens’ presence&mdash;while he overlooks his own.</p>

<p><h4>Conclusion</h4>
The entire structure of the Named and the Nameless runs throughout the film firmly in a harmonious combination of Yin and Yang. So are they with the Named and the Nameless. By reemploying materials of the other the artist seems to be doing nothing. But there is a shift in power within the work as she examines other potential readings. To expand on this wu-wei character in Vietnam the Movie, perhaps a few words from Lao Tsu on nonaction philosophy can conclude this essay:</p>

<p>“Therefore the sage goes about doing nothing, teaching no-talking.<br/>
The ten thousand things rise and fall without cease,<br/>
Creating, yet not.<br/>
Working, yet not taking credit.<br/>
Work is done, then forgotten.<br/>
Therefore it lasts forever.”
</p>

<p>Finally, in concept of the Named, Trinh Thi’s film portrays only the impressions of the West, especially of decisive men, who prefer to see Vietnam with only the war to review their history: the Yang voice. Voices of women, children, Vietnamese and even the artist are much softer, smaller or even muted: the Yin voice. In doing so, Vietnam the Movie reveals an unbalanced Yin-Yang structure, in which Yang elements are much more dominant as the cause of crisis. In sharp contrast to the black and white sentences written in English at the opening, HẾT—written in Vietnamese—is presented as the colorful end of the film. The Yin-Yang structure has changed from monism into pluralism. This end, therefore, means also no-end but might open up to a much more diverse debate, when Yin elements were also named. </p>

<p>In whatever way, the key discussion in Vietnam the Movie is not the Named within its Yin-Yang structure, but the Nameless as a suggestion for opening the door to a different way of debating history and de-colonialism. Things are not just reviewed from previous debates amongst powerful and less powerful voices but viewed from different elements and taken into account in a much more subtle way. It is not a way of returning to aboriginal cultures to restore national identities and rejecting
Western influences, but a return to nature, to insight, to nothingness and to the simplicity of formless substance,   or in the artist’s words, “the meaningless“. That return is stillness yet full of power for liberating oneself and balancing the societies. Beyond the debate between the East and the West is the way of acting nonaction leading to the right way for humankind as a state of harmonious Yin-Yang in body and mind.</p>
