<p>When Denisse Andrade and Hồng-Ân Trương invited me to contribute to Return to the Source, several images and memories crowded in my mind, constantly competing over which is most important, most definitive and most appropriate selection to engage Palestine. This is not an exceptional exercise to any engaged public intellectual. In general, we can never simply pick one thing to write about. Instead we have to contextualize and historicize, given the contrast between the U.S. context in which we work, think, teach, research and advocate, and the Palestine context about which we write and speak. And here I am not referring to Palestine in a limited geographical sense, i.e. the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River, under total Israeli colonial control. In counterhegemonic speak, it would be what Marc Lamont Hill referred to as “from the River to the Sea,” in his 2018 address to the United Nations on the International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I am referring to Palestine as transnationally imagined—the only possible way to think of Palestine also given that of the 11.5 million Palestinians, 4.7 live under Israeli colonial rule, while the remaining 6.8 million live in refugee camps or are scattered in international diasporas all over the world.</p>

<p>Writing and speaking in the US versus doing so in Palestine, demands over-historicizing and over-contextualizing Palestinians scholars, like other scholars in their shoes, do not wish to but feel compelled to provide. This is not only because Palestinians are vilified by a powerful pro-Israel propaganda machine that deliberately and systematically seeks to erase Palestine and Palestinians from existence in order to legitimatize the Zionist settler colonial project as a “naturalized return” and a “historical necessity” to prevent another Holocaust. Presenting Zionism and Israel, as Zionism’s materialist manifestation, as the only option to fight anti-Semitism makes it impossible for any of us to utter a single sentence on Palestine, as the case of Marc Lamont Hill shows, without having to first invoke the rich history of Jewishness and the diverse perspectives that challenge Zionist ownership of Jewishness.  
in which Zionism is a but a small episode that is not shared across time, place and history.</p> 

<p>In addition to distortions of Palestine by Zionist discourses, a related factor that heavily weighs in here has to do with the misrepresentations of marginalized communities from the Third World in Africa, Asia and Latin America, and Indigenous and Third World communities within the US colonial borders. This has recently been exemplified in the shutting down of the proposal for the Ethnic Studies Curriculum for California public schools. Spearheading these attempts were Zionist groups that complained that the inclusion of Arab Americans, Islamophobia and justice in and for Palestine, for example, produces anti-Semitism and makes Jewish students uncomfortable. However, this was not much different from the smokescreen that was applied against the Durban world conference on racism In a similar tactic used by white supremacists and Zionists in California today, in 2001, settler colonial regimes and their donors and NGO collaborators at WCAR cynically employed the necessary struggle against anti-Semitism to undermine the intent of WCAR to pass binding resolutions for reparations for genocide and slavery with the same commitment the international movement of WCAR sought against Zionism.</p>

<p>Finally and as this essay demonstrates, the absences, erasures and misreading of history are quite acute in the case of Palestine and other Third World communities. This make it a necessity rather than a choice to exert additional intellectual labor to present a textured, nuanced analysis to set the record on historical moments such as 1968.</p>

<p>My work is inspired by what I call The Spirit of ’68 as it was conceptualized then and as it manifests itself today. In 1968, students at what became San Francisco State University responded to the call of the Black Student Union (BSU) and the Third World Liberation Front (TWLF) that BSU formed to broaden the resistance to the Eurocentric Curriculum that erased the lived experiences of Indigenous communities and communities of color. The longest strike in the history of the US that is rarely mentioned compared with Columbia University or UC-Berkeley was in fact the most militant, most international and most anti-imperialist. The emphasis on the Third world was not a coincidence. It was deliberately selected by the Black Panthers Party who had a coordinated leadership on campus and in the community. The demand of the students was a College for Third World Studies. After almost a year of student strike and defiance, and university administration’s arrests, expulsions and other repressive tactics, the University finally realized that the students will not give up until their demands were met. However in a last minute maneuvering, the administration offered a College of Ethnic Studies instead of Third World Studies, fired a number of faculty members who were supportive of the students and ended the Experimental College.</p>

<p>Seeking to tell a Palestinian story by returning to the sources, I agonized for weeks to select one source. I finally gave up as it became clear to me that I had no choice but to engage in more than one archival source if I wanted to remain true to The Spirit of ’68 and the textured and nuanced history of a people’s struggle told in another language and in a context where that history was totally erased and misrepresented. The three sources I discuss here highlight issues with which Palestine engages the anti-colonial Third World, historically and contemporarily. These sources also raise the need to not only critically assess the archives themselves but how archives are allowed to travel transnationally across geographic (and colonial) borders, which archives get to travel, in what medium such travel occurs, and what is then preserved, consumed and reproduced? In the process I reflect on the politics of authorship and citation; gendered politics; and internationalism.<p> 

<h4>The politics of Authorship and Citation</h4>

<p>The first archival source is a poster of Al-Karamah Battle that I found on the Archives of the Palestinian Poster Project. The poster shows a kaffiyeh, the Palestinian scarf that popularized by the late Chairman of the PLO Yasser Arafat who wore it on his head and around his neck in a way that showed the historical map of Palestine from the river to the sea. The Kaffiyeh, superimposed over a bullseye background in black and red, two colors of the Palestinian flag, is interrupted in the middle by three images. The first is an Israeli tank, the second is a hill, and the third shows three Palestinian Fedayeen (standing for freedom fights and literally means those who sacrifice themselves) with Kalashnikovs on the ready. Underneath the image is a caption in Arabic, “Al-Karamah 1968 with a logo of a fedayie whose face is replaced by the map of Palestine on a red background. They are wearing a Kaffiyeh and a Kalashnikov behind them.</p>

<p>The Liberation Graphics’ Collection of Palestine posters was nominated to UNESCO’s Memory of the World Program 2016-2017. The source credit is listed as being “purchased by Liberation Graphics.” The artist is named “Al Muhandis Shukri.” Liberation Graphics lists two links to Wikipedia on armed struggle and the essay on the battle of Karameh. The poster is labeled on the website as “Fatah (Palestinian National Movement).</p>

<p>Al Karameh was a small village on the East Bank of the Jordan Valley. This was one site for Palestinian Fedayeen training Camps, set up by PLO groups following the 1967 Israeli occupation of the remainder of Palestine (the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem), along with the lands of Syria and Egypt. PLO groups, or what was referred to as the Palestinian resistance or the Palestinian revolution, launched raids from the camps against Israel in an effort to end the 1967 occupation and liberate Palestine that was colonized in 1948 when Israel was founded. This resistance strategy was spelled out in the Palestinian National Charter that was revised and adopted in 1968. The Charter includes several passages on the strategy of armed struggle as the only strategy to liberate Palestine.</p>

<p>Several parts of the poster represent Palestinian narrative and state of mind in 1968. The image of single fedayie without a face and that of the three Fedayeen is in accordance with a long tradition in Palestinian resistance that shies away from idealizing the individual but stresses collectivity and collectivism. The colors of the Palestinian flag, red, black, green and white also corresponds to Palestinian consensus. So is the recognition of Al-Karamah significance as a battle in which Palestinian Fedayeen with help from specific units in the Jordanian army defeated the might of the Israeli military in less than a year of the 1967 war in which Arab countries were defeated and the Arab world humiliated.</p>

<p>The poster however does several things that are not atypical of the career of archival material that cry out for critical unpacking. First, the logo of the fedayie does credit Fatah, the largest Palestinian group then and today is, along with Hamas, is one of two Palestinian parties that dominate the highest echelons of Palestinian politics. Fatah domination stems from its own popularity that was cemented by support from oil rich Arab States in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf. The late PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat was quite instrumental in cementing such support even though other oil rich states, such as Algeria and Iraq lent financial support to Palestinian leftist groups while politically supporting the PLO as the national liberation movement and the sole and legitimate representative of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>Though quite popular, Fatah was by far not the only Palestinian group that gained popularity and recruits before and after Al-Karamah. Fatah was contested by other PLO militant groups that had adopted Marxism and were part of the new left, such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) co-founded by George Habash and Wadie Haddad and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) that split from the PFLP in 1969.</p>

<p>Al Karamah 1968 Poster clearly credits the Unified Palestinian Information, an arm of the PLO, (not of Fatah) with its creation. It might have been the loss in translation from Arabic to English that prevented the founders of the Palestine Poster Project from realizing that there was an additional and a vital piece of information in the caption. This loss in translation however did contribute to Fatah and the PLO being seen as synonymous and thus leading to the marginalization and the lack of recognition of other equally legitimate Palestinian resistance groups. As one of my Black Panthers feminist colleagues asked, “Why do we always think Fatah when we think of Palestine?”</p>

<p>Another issue that reflects a major imbalance, voiced by scholars of Indigenous Studies and Third World Studies alike, speaks to the dictum that history is written by the victor not the vanquished. Though Palestinian people continue to resist and stay put on their land after over 70 years of founding of the State of Israel and 100 years of British colonial rule, Palestinian narratives remain unrecognized unless validated by Israeli scholarship. The dominance of English as a language as a medium for international communication, combined with the intensification of the corporatization of the production of knowledge further marginalizes justice-centered scholarship on Palestine. It is not surprising then that the Wikipedia articles cited in the Palestine Poster Project have been edited and reedited so that what was supposed to be an article on armed struggle is now an article on war. The other article the Palestine Poster Project cites on Battle of Karemeh credits the Jordanian army, not the Palestinian resistance, with the defeat of the Israeli military.</p>

<h4>Gendered Politics and the Women and Men of the Revolution</h4>

<p>Two images (thought there are so many more) compete for the second source of this essay. Here I return to Shadia Abu Ghazaleh who was 19 years old when a bomb she was assembling exploded and killed her on November 4, 1968. Shadia was a member of the Palestinian Marxist militant group, PFLP, and part of the phenomenon to which I have referred in other work as Jamilat Palestine. I used the term Jamilat to compare and contrast Palestinian women’s struggle to that of Algerian women during the war of liberation against French colonialism. Four women leaders of Algeria were named Jamila. In Palestine it was a group of young Palestinian women who engaged in armed resistance immediately following the 1967 Israeli occupation. Jamilat Palestine became well known after they were arrested, tortured and sentenced to long prison terms by the Israeli military. The women, Fedayiat (the feminine of Fedayeen) were freed in prison exchange agreement between the Israeli State and Palestinian and Lebanese resistance groups. Abu Ghazaleh was from my hometown Nablus and sister to two colleagues whom I have worked with and cited in my other work. Her late sister was Birzeit University professor and feminist writer and activist, Dr. Ilham Abu Ghazaleh. Among her other achievements, Ilham Abu Ghazaleh had translated a poem by a Cuban feminist titled, “to the comrades who do not wash their socks.” The poem was published in the newsletter of the Union of Palestinian Women’s Committees during the 1987 Intifada to reinforce the struggle for gender and sexual justice waged by Palestinian women and their allies to be dialectically connected to the struggle for justice in and for Palestine.</p>

<p>The second source to which I return is a photo of a Palestinian women’s demonstration in the streets of Jerusalem in 1968. The Palestinian women were protesting an Israeli military parade after annexing Jerusalem. I had not paid much attention to the faces in the photo though I had seen it often enough. On a closer look I found my own aunt, Samiha Khalil, my mother’s sister, or khaltou Samiha as we called her in the family. Outside of the family she was known as Khalti Im Khalil and was one of the leaders of the Palestinian anti-colonial movement under Israeli rule. I know that my aunt and my own mother (though not to the same degree of prominence or leadership) along with a whole generation were involved in resisting the occupation. 

<p>Unlike Shadia Abu Ghazaleh, the resistance waged by my aunt, mother and other women did not take the form of armed struggle to which the Palestine Poster Project refers. Involved in social association. Often referred to as “charitable societies,” due to their application to and classification status with the ministry of Social Affairs during Jordanian rule, most of these associations refused to register as such with the Israeli ministry of social affairs to signal their defiance against the Israeli occupation and refusal to recognize Israeli colonial rule that had displaced most Palestinians in 1948. Instead, these “society ladies” organized hunger strikes and held sit-ins at the offices of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) in solidarity with detained and imprisoned Palestinians. They drafted and signed petitions to the United Nations with the same rigor with which they knitted ski masks for the fedayeen and the fedayat and collected funds to support families of martyrs, prisoners and those whose homes were demolished as a form of Israeli military collective punishment. 

<p>I never knew until 1993 that my aunt was in fact the clandestine leader of the General Union of Palestinian Women (GUPW), which was one of the mass organizations of the PLO and the second oldest after the General Union of Palestinian Students. Her role and that of other women who worked very closely with her never revealed that information. Instead they let the GUPW activists outside Palestine, in Amman, Beirut, Damascus, Algeria, Tunisia and elsewhere to claim the spotlights and promote the feminist agenda while they silently and secretively worked on the grassroots level in Palestine.

<p>Though there are many more sources, I selected these two primarily because I want to comply with the Palestinian consensus on collectivity and resist the temptation to select one person to represent the struggle. I also did not include Leila Khaled here both because I have written a lot about her and because she seems to be the only Palestinian women known for hijacking planes though her history as a leader in the Palestinian movement and the Palestinian women’s movement tends to be completely erased in favor of freezing her in history and idealizing her role as a plane hijacker. 

<p>Here I want to argue against and challenge the recently recycled conventional wisdom in 3rd world women’s studies that women, always overshadowed by men during the 1960s movement, only became consciously feminist after their involvement and the sexist practices to which they were subjected by the male leadership. This is a cliché that is repeated in almost all studies of gender and revolution by colonial and anti-colonial scholars and activists alike. In the case of Palestine, it also takes Islamophobic and Orientalist overtones that seek to salvage the Zionist project and present it as a feminist emancipatory space in contrast with Palestinian, Arab and Muslim communities that are assumed to be exceptionally and inherently misogynist and homophobic, as if it were part of our DNA. The latest statements by most Israeli Zionist candidates in the Israeli Knesset attest to such tropes. 

<h4>Palestinian Internationalism and Revolutionary Solidarity</h4>

<p>I selected the third source from the Arab depth of Palestine to honor a term and the conceptual framing that underline it by the Palestinian resistance movement across the board Irrespective of party affiliation. The roots of such Arab grounding goes back to the anti-colonial resistance since the end of the 19th century and most of the 20th century. It arose during the waning days of the Ottoman rule and the rise of Turkish nationalism which in turn precipitated Arab nationalism. Competing discourses of Arabness and Muslimness were emerging in response to first French and British colonization of greater Syria. Exposed by Lenin in the October Revolution in 1917, the resistance grew after the 1917 Balfour Declaration through which British colonial authorities legitimized the Zionist movement and Zionist colonization of Palestine. </p>

<p>Arab nationalism grew during the 1950s era of decolonization against the British, the French and US that was increasingly intervening in the region especially after oil was discovered in the Arabian Peninsula and throughout the cold war. However Arab Nationalism was not the only tendency in the region. Arab communist parties competed Muslim Brotherhood, the Baath party in Syria and Iraq, and the nascent Arab National Movement that became the PFLP and the DFLP in the late 1960s. </p>

<p>The resistance against Israel, US intervention and allied Arab rulers produced an interesting form of tensions and alliances between different oppositional tendencies in the Arab world which did not exclude Palestine. Fatah had systematically declared its neutrality vis-à-vis the internal affairs of Arab states. However with a few exception of official leaders and some shameful episodes of collaborating with Arab oppressive regimes, most intellectuals and leaders in Fatah were allied with Arab oppositional movements. The alliances between the Palestinian resistance and Arab oppositional movements resonated with Palestinian international alliances in Vietnam, Southern Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean including Cuba.</p>

<p>Here I draw on the Arab depth and international solidarity. The 1968 source I return to is the poem eulogizing Ernesto Che Guevara after he was assassinated by the CIA in Bolivia on October 8, 1968. The poem was written by Egyptian communist Ahmad Fuad Nijim. Sheikh Imam, another member of the Egyptian Communist Party composed the music and sang the song that continues to be an icon of oppositional and anti-colonial resistance movements throughout the Arab world and its Diasporas.  </p>

<p>I was a teenager in 1968. However my cousins were all involved in the Palestinian resistance movement though I had no idea what they did. It was Samih, who passed away five years ago at the young age of 62, who brought this song to the family space and told us about it. Samih was studying in Italy at the time. I had assumed all along that he was involved in your usual student organizing. As the late June Jordan wrote about the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, “I did not know then and no one told me,” I only found in April 2019 how extensive his role was when another Palestinian former activists began to share oral history of things unwritten and unknown once I told him who I was. As cousin we were under the impression that Samih simply dropped out of school and failed as a student and that none of us was allowed to repeat this failure at education. However Samih had in fact quit his studies in Ferrara and returned home to play a bigger role in Palestinian resistance. </p>

<p>Ahmad Fuad Nijim and Sheikh Imam met in an Egyptian prison. They were not politically involved yet. In fact they both were serving sentences over drug charges. But just like Malcolm X, they became politicized in prison and ended up producing some of the most important songs for the whole Arab anti-colonial, anti-capitalist, and anti-Zionist movement. For them the prison was a revolving door. </p>

<p>The song, Guevara mat (Guevara died a valiant death) speaks of how people in churches and mosques, hoods, streets, coffee shops and in bars, mourned the death of Che Guevara, who died as a hero inside the forests. The song educates the Arab public about Guevara while criticizing those “antiques” who engage in food and consumerism. The song also criticizes armed chair revolutionaries who only speak about change but do not enact it in real way.</p>

<p>In the language of the pedagogy of the oppressed par excellence, Sheikh Imam and Ahmad Fuad Nijim raise consciousness in terms everyday people understand, He died without his comrades around him. “He cried out but no one was there to hear him.” Maybe his last breath was “farewell to a hungry generation” Imagine 100 million possibilities opposing to occupation.” </p>

<p class="quote">
“Workers, deprived: you have no salvation except with bombs and bullets<br/>
Rule is for fire and iron<br/>
Justice is speechless to coward<br/>
No alternative, no substitute <br/>
Either you prepare the army of salvation or you signal the end of the world.<br/>
</p>

<p>Nor did I know about Sheikh Imam and Ahmad Fuad Nijim. Many Palestinians were in love with Jamal Abdel Nasser. Palestinians like my own parents even refused to accept Nasser’s resignation after the 1967 defeat (he felt that he failed). In fact my mother and other women in the family and community went into mourning when he resigned until he agreed to withdraw his resignation. We did not know about the contradictions of Nasser’s rule, on one had a fierce anti colonialist who stood up to British, French and Israeli colonialism and nationalized the Suez Canal for the Egyptian people but on the other a ruthless leader who crushed communists, Muslim brothers as he did loyalist to the monarchy and its colonialist ties.</p>
<p>It was one of my first awakenings to the internationalism of Palestine and Arab revolutions and the solidarities international forces extended to Palestine. We were not alone was one of the most important lessons my cousin mentored me about.</p>
